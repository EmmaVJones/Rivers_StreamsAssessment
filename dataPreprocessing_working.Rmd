Run in R 3.5.1

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
library(tidyverse)
library(sf)
library(readxl)

```

This document walks users through the requisite data preprocessing steps for the 2020 IR Rivers and Streams Assessment decision support application. All initial steps are tested on 2018 IR data and thus need to be rerun for 2020 data when those datasets become available.

## Input data

#### Conventionals
Bring in Roger's conventionals dataset.
```{r conventionals2018}
conventionals <- read_excel('workingDatasets/CONVENTIONALS_20171010.xlsx',sheet = 'CONVENTIONALS')
#glimpse(conventionals)
```
