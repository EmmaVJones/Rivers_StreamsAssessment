Bio 'FS' Five VSCI surveys (2011-2012) with an average score of 65.9.  The fall samples received better scores due to the higher taxa richness, higher numbers of mayflies and scrapers as well as lower numbers of midges (Chironomidae).  The benthic assemblage in this reach of Catawba Creek indicates a slight tolerance to pollution in the spring but also had many taxa that are sensitive to pollution in the fall surveys.  The spring 2013 sample was possibly affected by two rainstorms that occurred 10 and 16 days prior to the sampling event.  The watershed has both forest and agricultural land cover with the adjacent land on the west side of the stream being dominated by pasture with a low density of cattle.  The limestone geology increases productivity of algae, macroinvertebrates and fish.  Habitat in this reach is slightly impacted by sediment deposition but most other habitat scores were in the optimal range.  

Supplemental Information:  March of 2014, Roanoke Cement Company planted 17,000 trees and shrubs alongside the creek on a farm they own and is leased  for pasture.  Approximately 98 acres of pasture were converted to riparian buffer with this project and should improve water quality in this reach.

2016 IR:  Bio 'FS' Four VSCI surveys with an average score of 69.2.   Stream flow during the fall 2011 survey was low with substantially less substrate available to collect macroinvertebrates than the spring.  In addition, fish community sampling in the fall produced very few fish in a 150m reach.  The lack of mayflies and scrapers in the fall may indicate intermittent conditions during periods of low rainfall.  The instream habitat is exceptional and riparian vegetation provides good canopy cover and stable stream banks. Low rainfall/flow is suspected of having an impact of the benthic community in the fall.

This station was sampled again in 2014 and will be sampled in even years as a semi-annual trend station. There were more stoneflies (primarily Leuctridae) in the spring sample and more mayflies (primarily Heptageniidae) in the fall samples.  The results of benthic sampling indicated a community dominated by pollution-sensitive taxa in both seasons but had lower taxa richness in the spring.

Abnormal fish lesions reported in this area.

Bio 'FS' Two VSCI surveys (fall 2013 & fall 2014) with an average score of 60.6.  These waters show signs of improvement in water quality due to the distance from industrial and municipal point sources in Covington and Clifton Forge, as well as urban NPS pollution.  Compared to the historical upstream control site (2-JKS030.65), there is a difference in the average VSCI scores (60.6 at this station versus 72.7 at 2-JKS030.65). 
Recent improvement in the historical trend of the benthic community may be due efforts in the watershed to reduce nutrient discharge to the river. In addition, a multi-agency special study is working to return more natural flow variability to the river during the dry summer and fall months.

Bio 'W'  One 2010 fall survey scoring spring NA and fall 53.5.  Two 2011 VSCI surveys were unsuitable for assessment. The benthic assemblage collected at this site indicates tolerance to acid stream conditions (pH = 5.4) as well as intermittent/headwater stream conditions (low numbers of mayflies and low %Scrapers).  The spring sample resulted in only 12 organisms collected in a 2 m2 area of substrate; whereas, several hundred organisms are typically collected with similar effort.  Due to the low number collected, an assessment score could not be calculated.  The fall 2010 sample had a low density of benthic macroinvertebrates but enough to calculate an SCI score.  This assemblage was dominated by Stoneflies from the family Capniidae (genus Allocapnia) which are tolerant of acid conditions and intermittent stream flow.  
The stream substrates at this site were stuck together by what appeared to be iron bacteria that had dried when the stream was dry.

Benthic overall status:  Fully Supporting (2002 IR).  This station was collocated with an ambient watershed station that did not have any water chemistry impairments.  Water chemistry in Sweet Springs Creek is greatly influenced by limestone (specific conductance typically > 700 uS).  The benthic survey was performed to determine how the benthic community in this stream compares to other CARV streams in the area and to determine if this could serve as a reference for other limestone influenced streams.  Black fly larvae (Simuliidae) and midge larvae (Chironomidae) dominated the community.
Since there were no other stations in the region with comparable water chemistry and habitat (marl deposits dominated the stream substrate), the sample could not be assessed by comparing to another stream.  Also, the VSCI was not developed for assessment of Limestone dominated streams.
The limestone geology in the watershed influences stream chemistry and habitat by the formation of large amounts of marl on the stream substrate therefore, limiting the types of benthic macroinvertebrates that can inhabit this stream reach.",NA,"2-SSC000.25","30 m",14895,"01487755","Sweet Spring Creek",460,46006,"2A",NA,"Sweet Springs Creek","12","V",NA,"Sweet Springs Creek from its confluence with Dunlap Creek to the West Virginia state line.","James-Upper",NA,"Yes",NA,"Perennial",NA,"Yes",1428.04601494

VA DEQs survey was initially performed during a project to validate the VASOS assessment on a number of sites throughout the state.  Even though the average VSCI score is in the Non-impaired range, sediment and other nonpoint source pollutants from storm water runoff might be limiting the taxonomic diversity.

Prior to the 2012-2013 sampling events in 2008, a tributary to Back Creek was impacted by a discharge of sediment from a construction site which may have impacted the sediment scores and benthic community at this station.  Likewise, other nonpoint source pollution from residential and agricultural land use in the watershed could also impact the benthic community.

Subsequent 2009 fall survey scored 52.8 and 2012 surveys scored spring 52.5 and fall at 64.9.  The abundance of macroinvertebrates that feed by scraping algae and periphyton (%Scrapers) has always been low indicating a lack of clean substrate or often scoured substrates.  The 2008, 2009, and 2012 habitat surveys find sand and fine sediment impact the stream substrate.  This would indicate continued sources of fines beyond the initial 2005 release.


2008,2010 & 2012 Cycle Assessments:  'J' Reserve Judgement.  Mayflies dominated the spring sample whereas; stoneflies and net-spinning caddisflies dominated the fall samples.  This station was sampled to determine the impact from an illegal discharge of sediment laden water from a holding pond at a construction site in fall 2005.  An upstream station (4ABAA023.29) was used as a control site.  Due to the improvement of scores in fall 2006 (60.9) and fall 2008 (70.3), VDEQ is reserving judgment until more data can be collected to determine whether, or not, the stream has recovered from the sediment release.
There was a moderate to severe immediate impact to the stream substrate from the sediment release.  Benthic substrates in riffles at this station were found to be 52% embedded by sand and fines in contrast to 30% embeddedness at the control site.  Immediately after the release, sediment deposition in riffles measured 3-5 and in pools was 8-10.  The impact site was nearly devoid of pool habitat due to the amount sediment deposited.",NA,"4ABAA023.07","10 m",13702,"01462652","Back Creek",460,46006,"4A",NA,"Back Creek","6a","III","NEW-1","Tributaries of the Roanoke River from Leesville Dam to Niagra Reservoir, unless otherwise designated in this chapter.","Roanoke",NA,NA,NA,"Perennial",NA,NA,1281.02118445

The average Stream Condition Index score (85.4) was one of the highest scores in this region of Virginia showing that the benthic community had good diversity and high abundance of pollution-sensitive taxa.  The spring sample had a higher abundance of mayflies (Ephemeroptera) and scrapers (macroinvertebrates that need clean substrate surfaces to feed on and the fall had more stoneflies (Plecoptera).  This is normal for headwater/mountain streams where the various types of macroinvertebrates have seasonal changes in abundance as they move through their life cycles.

Bio 'IM' Five (2009-2011) VSCI surveys.  The average VSCI score is 47.1 indicating an impaired condition.  Instream habitat (substrate) has been impacted by fine sediment.  Riparian zone vegetation has been removed and stream banks eroded due to unrestricted cattle access to the stream.  This region was affected by several drought years in earlier assessments.  Less runoff of non-point source pollution during the low rainfall periods potentially resulted in an improvement in the benthic community.  Additionally, recent installation of agricultural best management practices in the watershed have improved water quality.  The Soil and Water Conservation District is implementing agricultural best management practices in the watershed.

Bio 'IM' Four 2010-2011 Virginia Stream Condition Index (VSCI) surveys report an average score of 55.40 for 2014.  The instream habitat (substrate) at this site has been impacted by fine sediment.  The riparian zone vegetation is in the marginal to poor categories. 

Outside Data Window:  Previous to the 2012  Integrated Report (IR) there were no additional data beyond the 2008 IR where two VSCI surveys (2001 - 2002 all Spring)  score an average of 52.8.  This site was first surveyed on 7/26/00 as part of benthic TMDL special study in the Blackwater River Watershed.  It was sampled in spring 2001 and 2002 along with the other impact sites in the North Fork of the Blackwater River.  The benthic community was dominated by several pollution tolerant organisms including midge fly larvae (Chironomidae) which are tolerant of sediment and low dissolved oxygen.  The 1999-2001 drought impacted the ecoregion reference stations at Green Creek and Pigg River resulting in a decrease in the benthic community scores.  However, the historically impaired stations in the North Fork and the Blackwater did not appear to decrease with the reference site.  Instead, some metrics (%Chironomidae, %Ephemeroptera) improved.  It appears that less runoff from adjacent fields and pastures may have helped improve the benthic community scores during the drought.",NA,"4ABNR001.53","10 m",16445,"01474848","South Fork Blackwater River",460,46006,"4A",NA,"Blackwater River, South Fork Lower","6a","V","NEW-1","South Fork Blackwater River form its confluence with the Blackwater River upstream to Roaring Run.","Roanoke",NA,"Yes",NA,"Perennial",NA,NA,325.507019455

Bio 'IM' Two 2012 VSCI surveys scoring spring 48.7 and fall 59.6.  These surveys indicate a community dominated by pollution-tolerant taxa in the spring including midges and blackflies.  There are a higher percentage of mayflies in the fall but both seasons had relatively low taxa richness, low numbers of stoneflies and low numbers of organisms in the scraper feeding category which require clean rock surfaces to feed upon.  The instream habitat is affected by sediment deposition (low Sed score) with more than 50% of the stream bottom covered by fine particles.  The sediment load in the stream also results in the low Embeddedness score meaning that the interstitial spaces between rocks is clogged by fine material thus limiting available habitat for sensitive macroinvertebrates.

Spring surveys scored 53.7 (2010) and 59.3 (2011) while fall scores are 62.5 (2010) and 67.74 (2011) additional data are needed to determine support or non-support.

Benthic Overall Status:  'NI' This benthic community displays a recovery at this site relative to upstream stations (4ABNR000.40 and 4ABWR061.20).  Taxa richness and the abundance of pollution sensitive organisms are greater at this station.  In the spring of 2001, the site scored below the lower limit (60.0) for a non-impaired benthic community.  However, the historical scores (1998-2000)  indicate this score is an anomaly.  The previous spring and fall sample were non-impaired and the following spring sample scored non-impaired.  The impaired spring 2001 sample showed an increase in Chironomidae and a decrease in total taxa, %Ephemeroptera, and %Plecoptera and Trichoptera minus Hydropsychiidae.  The following non-impaired spring sample resulted in the opposite of this score.  In addition, a 2005 probabilistic monitoring station (4ABWR045.01) located 0.79 miles downstream scored 71.22 and 61.19 in the spring and fall, respectively.  Therefore, it is shown that the 6-yr average for this assessment period is not indicative of the condition of the benthic community at this site.  The site is assessed as non-impaired.

Bio 'IM'- Five Six VSCI surveys (2007-2011) VSCI surveys with an average score of 53.5.  Water quality in this reach is affected by NPS pollution from dairy farms from primarily the North Fork of the Blackwater River.  Habitat degradation in the form of sediment deposition and riparian vegetation removal occurs at this sight as a result of agricultural practices.  This area was affected by several drought years within the 2004 thru 2008 assessment periods.  Less runoff of nonpoint source pollution during low rainfall periods potentially resulted in an improvement in the benthic community.  Recent installation of agricultural best management practices in the watershed also contribute to improved water quality.

Bio 'IM' One 2008 VSCI survey scoring 56.5.  This station was sampled as part of the Nutrient Criteria Special Study in 2008.  Stations were selected based on historical nutrient levels and data on benthic macroinvertebrates, algae, periphyton and habitat were collected to be compared with nutrients.  The VSCI score indicates a stressed community with low taxonomic diversity and low abundance of pollution-sensitive organisms.  Habitat surveys indicated a stream section with substrates that were impacted by excessive fine sediments.  Chemical analyses indicate high phosphorus levels.  Elevated TP values, greater than 0.20 mg/l, are found in nine of 16 samples.  The elevated values range from 0.21 to  0.68 mg/l.

Two 2011 VSCI surveys scoring 52.2 spring and 74.1 fall with an average of 63.2.  The spring benthic sample score was influenced by a high number of Chironomidae (midges) and low numbers of scrapers; whereas, the fall sample had much higher numbers of stoneflies and scrapers.  The spring sample was possibly affected by several rainstorms and scouring flows two-three weeks before the survey.  The immediate land use at this station was forest on one side of the river and fields/pasture on the other.

2018 IR Bio 'IM' from six VSCI surveys (2012, 2014, 2015) with an average score of 59.5. Previous assessments observed that the benthic community declined overall from Fall 2003 to the Fall 2005 survey and that it improved during Spring and Fall 2004 before declining in the Fall of 2005.  Data collected during the 2014 assessment period show that 3 out of 4 samples were above the impairment threshold with an average VSCI score of 60.2.  Additional data collected in 2014 show an improvement in the Spring score and a decline below the impairment threshold in the Fall.  The Spring 2015 sample declined compared to the 2014 Spring score and the Fall 2015 score improved well above the impaired threshold. While the final 6-yr average is approaching the non-impaired threshold the Spring score is well below the impaired threshold.  The variability of the benthic macroinvertebrate community between Spring and Fall seasons and the consistently low Spring scores indicates stress to the community and an assessment as Impaired.  

2016 IR Bio 'IM' Six VSCI surveys (2009-2010; 2012 & 2014) produce an average score of 59.7 resulting in an impaired condition.  Both spring and fall samples collected in 2009 (fall 67.6) and 2010 (spring 60.5) indicate water quality is non-impaired. Following the 2009 and 2010 samples the VSCI scores declined.  One sample was below the impairment threshold (spring 2012 at 51.2) and one above (fall 2012 at 63.9).  The 2016 assessment finds all spring scores were lower than fall scores.  The 6 year average is slightly below the impairment threshold with both 2014 scores (57.0 & 59.9) below the impairment threshold of 60.  

2014 IR Bio 'J' data report a 6 yr. avg. score of 60.8.  Both 2009 & 2010 spring/fall indicate water quality is non-impaired. Following the 2009 and 2010 samples the VSCI scores declined.  
 
2012 three VSCI surveys (2005 & 2009-2010) with an avg. score of 54.28.  The final 6-yr. avg. (n=3) VSCI score is driven by a fall 2005 score of 34.69.  For seven seasons samples were not collected at this station.  The eighth and ninth seasons following the 34.69 score the VSCI scores were non-impaired. More data need to be collected to determine if the 2005 impaired VSCI score is an indicator of typical water quality or an indicator of the abnormal runoff and flows during the active hurricane season of 2004.  2010 data window Bio 'IM' where four VSCI surveys (2003-2005) record impairment with an average VSCI score of 49.9.  Historically sedimentation has decreased the amount of substrate available for macroinvertebrate colonization.  Five VSCI surveys (2001-2005) average score of 51.4 finding impairment in 2008.  The benthic community declined from fall 2001 to fall 2003 and improved during spring and fall 2004.  The fall 2004 survey resulted in a non-impaired score of 65.08.  This is the highest VSCI score found at this station.

4AROA215.13- Bio 'FS'  Three VSCI spring surveys (2009, 2010 & 2012) and one 2012 Fall score of 72.2; with an average score of 62.9.  Benthic community analyses result in good biological condition scores for the Roanoke River in the cities of Salem and Roanoke.  This station was added to assist in defining the impact of urban NPS pollution to the Roanoke River.  It is also co-located with an ambient watershed station that indicates good water quality.  Generally, community analyses result in Non-Impaired biological condition scores. Based on the Spring 2012 VSCI score being below the impairment threshold and declining nine points from 2010, the Spring 6 year seasonal average is listed as impaired.  However, the overall 6 year average remains above the impairment threshold and yields a Non-Impaired assessment.

The Roanoke River biological monitoring station 4AROA215.13 is in a riffle with constraining features that result in a faster, deeper, larger substrate riffle than the nearest stations at 4AROA224.54 and 4AROA212.17.  4AROA224.54 is upstream and 4AROA212.17 is downstream of the station in question.  Habitat at these two comparison stations is characterized by a broad stream bed with diverse substrate and lower stream velocity.  

The best professional explanation of the lower VSCI score is attributed to difficult spring sampling conditions (greater depth and velocity); larger substrate (small boulders and bedrock) and natural variability.  The resulting low VSCI score is potentially not representative of overall water quality in this segment.  Aside from these facts, there is not an observed water quality condition that appears to cause the station to score below the impairment threshold.

2016 BENTHIC DELIST
Bio 'FS' Four VSCI surveys (2013-2014) with an average score of 71.4. 
The station is located in the front yard of a residence near the headwaters of the stream.  Upstream of the station the land cover is dominated by forest.  However, shortly above the sample site, the property had historically been used as a saw mill but that area is currently vegetated.  The stream currently flows through two culverts that allow for driveway crossings immediately above the sample reach.  Within the sample reach, the stream has poor instream habitat as indicated by mostly low scores for substrate, velocity, and sediment.  The channel has been altered from its natural shape.  The immediate bank vegetation is mowed down to the water line and the riparian vegetation has been completely removed.  Despite the habitat impacts, the benthic community, in most samples, consisted of pollution sensitive taxa.

2016 IR Bio 'IM' The 2016 data window reports eleven VSCI surveys (2009-2014) with a 6 year average score of 58.0 and 2 year score of 55.7.  The benthic macroinvertebrate community indicates a water quality pattern of recovery followed by years of decline. Overall water quality at this site remains impaired.  Recent surveys also show that the benthic community is dominated by the tolerant organisms (Hydropsychidae, Chironomidae, Pleuroceridae and Simulidae) a possible indication of organic and nutrient pollution.  

2014 IR Bio 'IM' Eleven VSCI surveys (2007-2012) with average 6 year score of 54.3 and two year score of 61.2.  The station is below two hydroelectric dams resulting in daily fluctuations of flow and temperature.  Point and non-point source pollution and sediment appear to affect the river.  This station is downstream of the Lower Smith River Wastewater Treatment Plant (Henry County PSA) that closed in November 2005.  The closure did not appear to have an immediate positive affect on the benthic community.  However, since the last assessment the highest VSCI score  (68.59, Spring 2012) is recorded.  The following seasons sample declined well below the non-impaired threshold of VSCI 60 at 49.17.  

Outside Data Window:
2010 IR- Bio 'IM' Seven VSCI surveys (2003-2008) with an average score of 57.4.  This station is the furthest downstream biological monitoring site and the first site where the benthic community historically showed signs of recovery.  This site has shown improvement in the Fall scores since Fall 2006, but a decline in the Fall 2008 sample.  Non-point source urban runoff and sediment appear to affect the river.  The station is located downstream of Leatherwood Creek which may be a significant source of sediment.  Recent surveys show that the benthic community is dominated by the moderately tolerant caddisfly Hydropsychidae, an indication of organic and nutrient pollution.  There was some improvement in the benthic community between 1999 and 2001, and 2006 and 2008.  Improved water quality may have been the result of operational improvements at the Martinsville WWTP.  However, the decline in benthic community scores in Spring 2006 and Fall 2008 indicates that water quality is still degraded.

2014 IR- Bio 'IM' Eleven VSCI surveys (2007-2012) with average 6 year score of 54.3 and two year score of 61.2. The station is below two hydroelectric dams resulting in daily fluctuations of flow and temperature.  Point and non-point source pollution and sediment appear to affect the river.  This station is downstream of the Lower Smith River Wastewater Treatment Plant (Henry County PSA) that closed in November 2005.  The closure did not appear to have an immediate positive affect on the benthic community.  However, since the last assessment the highest VSCI score  (68.59, Spring 2012) is recorded.  The following seasons sample declined well below the non-impaired threshold of VSCI 60 at 49.17.

Spring bioassessments at this station show a decline since 2009 and Fall bioassessments show a slight improvement since 2009.  Overall VSCI scores are declining.  Similar to station 4ASRE031.00, this reach of the river is impacted by the operation of one hydroelectric dam, sediment deposition and urban NPS runoff.  Sediment deposition in this reach of the Smith River may negatively affect the benthic community.

Bioassessments at this station have shown a slight decline in the benthic macroinvertebrate community over the last several years.  Fluctuating flows from Philpott Dam have an affect on the community.  During recent surveys, it appears that sediment deposition has increased in this reach of the Smith River.  Aerial photographs have shown areas of recent logging in the Reed Creek watershed.  This is possibly a result of the upstream scouring caused by discharges from Philpott Dam as well as inputs from tributaries such as Reed Creek.

Other Station Probabilistic Data:
4ATKR015.40- A 2007 probabilistic site.  Two VSCI surveys average score of 59.8.  In contrast to an average score below 60 at this station, two downstream stations on Tinker Creek scored above 60 during surveys in 2008.  A nearby station at Tinker Mill Road (4ATKR014.16) had a VSCI score of 73.0 in the fall of 2008.  Several types of local land use may be sources of nonpoint source pollution to Tinker Creek.  These include agriculture, subdivisions and a cement plant.  Despite these, the fall sample found a community dominated by pollution-sensitive taxa.  Two observations each of DO, Temp, pH, NH3-N, and water column metals- 'FS'.  A single E.coli observation does not exceed the instantaneous criterion- 'IN'.  2007 sediment no PEC SV excursions- metals only.

BIO 'J' Four VSCI surveys (2013-2014) with an average score of 52.3.  This stream was originally sampled upstream in three locations at the request of the West Central Regional Office DEQ Waste staff.  This stream begins upslope of the Martinsville Sanitary Landfill then flows through a pipe that is buried below the landfill.  In 2003 the stream appeared to be impacted by landfill leachate.  Volatile organic chemicals (VOCs) were found in both groundwater and surface water samples collected down gradient of the landfill.  

This new station was sampled to determine the status of the benthic community at a location well beyond the landfill boundary and above the confluence with Jones Creek as well as to validate the assessment of upstream station (4AXMP001.26) sampled in the fall of 2006.

This site was chosen as a targeted semi-annual wadeable station and VDEQ will be sampling it during even numbered years.  VDEQ is reserving judgment during this assessment cycle since biologists will be returning to the site in 2016.  The station is in a small headwater stream with low scores for habitat availability, sediment deposition, bank erosion and flow.  The stream channel is small and is naturally dominated with shallow water habitat.  The flow in the stream was either naturally low or was impacted by a pond upstream.  Rainfall and flow were higher in 2013 and 2014 compared with 2012.  Despite flow in spring and fall of both years, it appears that the stream could be intermittent or would be if the pond in the headwaters did not keep the channel supplied with water year round.

Bio- 'IM'; 2012 probabilistic site and RB.  Four VSCI surveys (2010) with an average score of 42.9.  NPS pollution from agricultural sources has impacted this section of Back Creek.  The habitat surveys indicate that the stream is impacted by sediment deposition, riparian vegetation removal, channel alteration (straightening of the stream), and destabilized stream banks.  Additionally, the water in Back Creek is often turbid from cattle disturbance of stream banks and instream sediments.  These impacts result in stream substrate and water that limits colonization of benthic macroinvertebrates and fish.  
In 2008 TMDL Implementation Plan projects for the bacteria and general standard (benthic) impairment were beginning to be installed and should have a positive effect on the benthic community for the long term.  The Fall 2012 VSCI scores are an improvement over all previous scores.

This station was sampled as part of the Nutrient Criteria Special Study in 2008.  Stations were selected based on historical nutrient levels and data on benthic macroinvertebrates, algae, periphyton and habitat were collected to be compared with nutrients.  
Bio 'FS' One 2008 VSCI survey scoring 62.3.  Taxonomic diversity in the benthic macroinvertebrate community was not exceptional but the relative abundance of pollution-sensitive organisms was high.  The habitat survey indicated a stream section with substrates that were impacted by excessive fine sediments and a riparian vegetative buffer that was impacted by roads

2014 DelIst Statement:  The waters are delisted with the 2014 assessment as bacteria (escherichia coli (E.coli)) excursions of the 235 cfu/100 ml instantaneous criterion are three of 35 observations.  An 8.5% exceedance rate at station 9-NEW107.51 (Allisonia USGS Gage) results in the delisting of these 1999 Consent Decree waters.  The 2004 initial 303(d) Listing is based on six of 53 fecal coliform observations exceeding the former WQS instantaneous criterion of 400 cfu/100 ml.  One of six 2004 E. coli  samples exceeded the current E.coli WQS instantaneous criterion of 235 cfu/100 ml; and were insufficient to assess as per WQS [9 VAC 25-260-170.A.1. Bacteria; other waters].  Twelve samples were required at that time to 303(d) List the parameter.  E.coli are initially Listed with the 2006 IR where four of 21 Escherichia coli (E.coli)  observations are in excess of the instantaneous criterion.  Integrated Reports (IRs) from 2006 onward 303(d) Listed these waters for contravention of the E.coli WQS instantaneous criterion.  The 2014 IR reports full support of the Recreational Use with an exceedance rate less than 10.5%.

Bio 'FS' Four VSCI surveys (2011 & 2014) with an average score of 61.5.  The spring 2011 sample had low numbers of pollution-sensitive taxa and a high abundance of midges (Chironomidae).  The fall sample had lower diversity but a higher abundance of stoneflies and other sensitive taxa.  Historically, this station was used as an upstream reference for the Peak Creek sites downstream and had better VSCI scores.  Both 2014 samples had high abundance of mayflies and were dominated by sensitive taxa.  Instream habitat scores are mostly in the optimal range.  Riparian vegetation is impacted with narrow buffers immediately upstream as a result of residential land use.  There are no point source discharges above this site.  Gatewood Reservoir is located about five miles upstream.  Historical surveys have shown that during drought periods, this reach of Peak Creek may experience impacts from low flows and habitat limitations.

The chemical and habitat data from biomonitoring and ambient sampling shows conditions favorable for benthic macroinvertebrates. However, the station is located in a section of Slate Branch that experienced a severe crayfish/macroinvertebrate kill in late January 2006. The kill began approximately five miles upstream in an unnamed tributary and extended into Stroubles Creek, a half mile downstream from this site. Although the source was not found, pesticides were suspected. Follow up monitoring was performed to test for recovery of the benthic community.  The abundance of organisms in the spring 2006 sample was very low relative to the reference site. The abundance of macroinvertebrates has increased over time as has the relative abundance of pollution-sensitive taxa.

Bio 'FS' one 2010 VSCI spring survey scoring 70.5.  This reach is sometimes dewatered in the fall resulting in limited seasonal variability in assessments.  In fall 2010, there was no water in the stream channel.  Historically, when flows are available to sample in the fall, the community consists of sensitive organisms and has been dominated by mayfly and stonefly families.  In summer 2005, a truck carrying hydrated lime wrecked in Stony Creek killing fish throughout this reach.  This reach was dry in fall 2005 and could not be sampled.  The community assemblage in the spring 2010 sample appears similar to historical springtime assemblages indicating no long-lasting effects from the truck wreck.  The stream is believed to be naturally dewatered and flows below the surface from above this site until the confluence with the New River.

Bio 'J' Four VSCI surveys (2010 & 2012) surveys with a score of 59.1.  This station was sampled to determine the impacts from a lime truck spill occurring in June 2005.  NPS runoff from a lime plant across the road may periodically impact this site.  This site also has a narrow riparian buffer between the stream and Rt. 635.  Numerous residences along the stream between the National Forest boundary and this station possibly contribute NPS pollution.  Lime scale is noticeable on rocks in and along the stream and filamentous algae has been prevalent at this station but not at others in Stony Creek.  The station was  sampled in 2010 and 2012 after citizen complaints about potential runoff from a lime plant/quarry.  Compared to upstream and downstream sites on Stony Creek the benthic community at this station has lower VSCI scores that appear to be driven partially by feeding modes of the organisms.  There are usually lower numbers of organisms that are called Scrapers (scrape periphyton from clean substrates) and higher numbers of Hydropsychid caddisflies which are filter feeders (build nets to collect fine organic matter).  During the past few assessment cycles, the average VSCI has declined.

Benthic Assessment Summary Bio 'IM':
2012 Nine VSCI surveys (2006 - 2010) average score of 45.7.
2010 Seven VSCI surveys (2003 & 2006 - 2008) with an average score of 45.6.
2008 Six VSCI surveys (2001 - 2003 & 2006) with an average score of 45.6.
The moderately pollution tolerant caddisfly family Hydropsychidae and fly family Chironomidae were the second most common macroinvertebrates during these surveys.  This community indicates the benthic community is exposed to moderate level of pollution, possibly a nutrient source that provides the Hydropsychidae the opportunity to be second most dominant.  Thus, this stream reach shows evidence of yearlong pollution.  Habitat condition at this station is suboptimal, impacted by sediment and poor riparian vegetation zones.  The mostly open canopy allows for increased water temperatures and primary production resulting in large mats of algae and bacteria on the stream substrate during the summer and fall.

The 2009 survey yielded a similar score.  The spring 2014 sample occurred in early June which is late in the season and possibly the reason for low numbers on mayflies, stoneflies and caddisflies after they emerged to their adult stage.

Bio 'FS' two VSCI spring surveys (2011-2012) with an average score of 70.7.  The stream surfaces from the Floyd landfill in a spring box and is impacted by growths of iron bacteria and sphaerotilus (sewage fungus).  The stream substrate was too impacted by bacterial growth to sample for benthic macroinvertebrates;  Dissolved oxygen and Specific conductance were greatly impacted where the stream exits the landfill but had recovered by the time the stream exits landfill property at the sampled site.  A May 2011 habitat survey shows most parameters are in the optimal range.  Sediment deposition was the only parameter found to be in the marginal range.  During the 2012 habitat survey, scores for sediment deposition and several other parameters had declined, some were due to lower stream flow.  The 2011 sample is dominated by mayflies, stoneflies and other generally pollution-sensitive taxa.  The dominant mayfly taxa, Ephemerellidae (50% of all organisms) is somewhat tolerant of excessive sediment and several stonefly taxa present are known to be tolerant of iron precipitate and organic enrichment. The June 2012 sample finds the number of mayflies very low but stoneflies (51%) are numerous.",NA,"9-XEM000.30","10 m",426,NA,NA,460,46003,"9",NA,"Dodd Creek, UT (XEL)","2","VI",NA,"West Fork Little River from its confluence with Little River upstream including all named and unnamed tributaries.","New",NA,"Yes",NA,"Intermittent",NA,NA,1146.62852882
